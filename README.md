# UNet-GAN-Alzheimer-ConvMixer
This project implements an Alzheimer’s disease classification pipeline using brain MRI images. Images are first preprocessed using MATLAB-based linear registration for anatomical alignment. A U-Net GAN is used for data augmentation, followed by a ConvMixer model for classifying MCI and CN subjects.
