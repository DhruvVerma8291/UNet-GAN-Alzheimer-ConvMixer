# Results and Evaluation

## Evaluation Strategy
- 5-Fold Cross Validation
- Class-weighted training

## Metrics Used
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Observations
- GAN augmentation improved class balance
- Linear registration improved convergence stability
- ConvMixer achieved strong performance with fewer parameters

## Future Improvements
- Extend to multi-class Alzheimer’s staging
- Use 3D ConvMixer
- Incorporate non-linear registration
